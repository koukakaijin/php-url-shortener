Simple url shortener in php

Currently using base64 .
Basic counter of number of times shorted and number of times used for each link.
Support http and https (will be updated to regex).
Very basic anti-spam.

"config" file required in index.php should have the ddbb connection settings
"mysql commands" file contains the scripts to create the tables necessary to use this example.
